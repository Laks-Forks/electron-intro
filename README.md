An easy approach to start building apps with Electron.js

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

I made this repo to a post that i wrote at [Tableless](http://tableless.com.br/introducao-ao-electron/) talking about [Electron.js](http://electron.atom.io/).
